In this article, we will show you how to download and install Adobe PostScript Printer Driver for Windows 7. There are two methods you can try: using the Adobe PDF printer or using the Adobe PostScript SDK.
 
## Method 1: Using the Adobe PDF printer
 
The Adobe PDF printer is a virtual printer that can create PDF files from any printable document. It also supports PostScript printing, so you can use it as a PostScript printer driver. However, the Adobe PDF printer may not be installed by default when you install Acrobat Standard on Windows 7. To manually install the Adobe PDF printer, follow these steps:
 
1. Click Start > Control Panel > Devices and Printers.
2. Select Add a printer.
3. In the Add a Device dialog box, select Add a local printer.
4. If the option is not visible, click The printer that I want isn't listed.
5. In the Add Printer dialog box, select Add a Local Printer or Network printer with Manual Settings.
6. Select Use an existing port option and select Documents\\\*.pdf (Adobe PDF) from the drop-down list.
7. Click Next.
8. Click Have Disk.
9. Click Browse and then navigate to the location - C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Adobe\\Acrobat <version>\\Acrobat\\Xtras\\AdobePDF</version>
10. Select AdobePDF.inf from the list.
11. Click Open and then click OK.
12. You see many Adobe PDF Converters on the list. Count six down from the top and select the printer.
13. Click Next (you may have to try this multiple times to find the correct Converter from the list that works with your version of Windows).
14. Name your printer as Adobe PDF.
15. Follow onscreen instructions to complete the installation.

Now you have installed the Adobe PDF printer as a PostScript printer driver. You can print any document to this printer and choose to save it as a PDF or send it to another physical printer[^1^].
 
## Method 2: Using the Adobe PostScript SDK
 
The Adobe PostScript SDK is a software development kit that allows you to create your own PostScript printer driver for Windows 7. It is licensed by leading Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) and has been at the core of more than 20 million devices since its launch[^2^]. To use the Adobe PostScript SDK, you need to have some programming skills and knowledge of PostScript language. You can download the SDK from the Adobe website and follow the documentation and samples to create your own driver. The SDK includes:

- The core PostScript interpreter engine
- A set of device drivers for various output devices
- A set of utilities for font management, color management, compression, encryption, etc.
- A set of APIs for integrating with applications and operating systems

The Adobe PostScript SDK is a powerful and flexible tool for creating custom PostScript printer drivers for Windows 7. However, it may not be suitable for beginners or casual users who just want to print documents with PostScript support[^2^].
