In this article, we will show you how to download and flash the BIOS+ME file for your Gigabyte GA-H55M-S2 motherboard using a tool called Flash Programming Tool (fptw.exe). This tool is provided by Intel and it allows you to write the BIOS+ME file directly to the flash memory of your motherboard. Before you proceed, make sure you have a backup of your important data and a stable power supply. Also, do not interrupt the flashing process or turn off your computer until it is finished, as this may cause irreversible damage to your motherboard.
 
## Step 1: Download the BIOS+ME file and the Flash Programming Tool
 
The first step is to download the BIOS+ME file and the Flash Programming Tool from the links below. The BIOS+ME file is a zip file that contains a bin file named h55-s2-me+bios.bin. This bin file has both the BIOS and the ME firmware data for your Gigabyte GA-H55M-S2 motherboard. The Flash Programming Tool is a rar file that contains an exe file named fptw.exe. This exe file is the tool that will flash the bin file to your motherboard.

## Step 2: Extract the files from the zip and rar files
 
The next step is to extract the files from the zip and rar files that you downloaded. You can use any software that can extract zip and rar files, such as WinRAR or 7-Zip. After extracting, you should have two files: h55-s2-me+bios.bin and fptw.exe. You can put them in any folder you want, but make sure they are in the same folder.
 
## Step 3: Flash the bin file with fptw.exe
 
The final step is to flash the bin file with fptw.exe. To do this, you need to open a command prompt window as an administrator. You can do this by clicking on the Start menu, typing cmd in the search box, right-clicking on Command Prompt and choosing Run as administrator. Alternatively, you can press Windows key + X and choose Command Prompt (Admin) from the menu.
 
Once you have opened a command prompt window as an administrator, you need to navigate to the folder where you have put h55-s2-me+bios.bin and fptw.exe. You can do this by using the cd command followed by the path of the folder. For example, if you have put them in C:\BIOS, you can type cd C:\BIOS and press Enter.
 
After navigating to the folder, you need to type the following command and press Enter:

    fptw.exe /f h55-s2-me+bios.bin

This command will start flashing the bin file to your motherboard. You will see a progress bar showing how much of the file has been written. Wait until it reaches 100% and then restart your computer. Do not turn off your computer or interrupt the flashing process until it is done.
 
## Conclusion
 
You have successfully fixed the ME firmware data on your Gigabyte GA-H55M-S2 motherboard by flashing a new BIOS+ME file using fptw.exe. You should now be able to
